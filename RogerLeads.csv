HSH.com, our consumer-facing website, continues unaffected by this, and our mission of being the most complete, objective and authoritative place for mortgage information, mortgage calculators, tools, help and expertise remains fully intact. Since our beginnings, HSH has been a consumerist organization. Our extensive library of must-know articles is at your disposal, free of charge, as are our expert-level calculators and tools, and in our pages you'll find the same objective advice we've offered since HSH was founded in 1979. For decades, HSH data and insight were used by virtually every entity in the mortgage business, including regulators like the FHFA, secondary market makers like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the nation's largest banks and independent mortgage companies and local and regional lenders. We also marketed our survey data directly to consumers as a portion of our award-winning Homebuyer's Mortgage Kit, which at one time was ranked as ""One of the Hundred Best Deals in America"" by Money Magazine. The Residential Mortgage Update was our flagship survey product for many years, listing rates and terms from dozens (or even hundreds) of lenders with current rates and terms for a range of popular (and sometimes esoteric) mortgage products. Various editions of our Mortgage Trends charts and Statistical Releases appeared widely in major news media, and our weekly MarketTrends newsletter was a leading source of news and analysis about mortgages and mortgage markets, as it still is today.

And what was true then is still true today: home is our favorite place to be. Throughout all the joys and challenges that life brings, home always seems to be right in the middle of it. Its what catches us, and also what lifts us up. Its where we retreat, where we are restored, and also where we bring our community together to share a meal at the table. But weve learned that home doesnt have to be a physical destination. Any place you feel you feel known, loved, and always welcomed back is a home of its own. We believe these things so deeply that everything we do at Magnolia is in pursuit of inspiring people to create a home and a life they love. And whether you find us mostly online or at the Market here in Waco, inside the pages of our magazine or on the shows of Magnolia Network, it is our ongoing desire that any time you spend with us will help guide you there.",,"Furniture","Retail",,,,,"500","500 - 1,000","$100 mil. - $250 mil.","105556",,"PRIVATE","Waco","Texas","United States","601 Webster Ave, Waco, Texas, 76706, United States","","false",,,,"true","Magnolia",,"Vice President, eCommerce","9617375110"
